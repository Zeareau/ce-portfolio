# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# My Personal Portfolio — christopherenriquez.dev

Hi, I'm Christopher Enriquez. This is the portfolio website I built to introduce myself, highlight my work, and showcase what I'm interested in.  
It’s responsive, animated, and live at [christopherenriquez.dev](https://christopherenriquez.dev), hosted with GitHub Pages using a custom domain.

---

## Tech Stack

- React with Vite — fast build tool and modern frontend framework
- Tailwind CSS — utility-first CSS framework for quick styling
- Framer Motion — used for animation and transitions
- GitHub Pages — free static site hosting
- Namecheap — for domain registration and DNS setup

---

## Purpose

I created this to serve as an introductory IT project that was more front-end focused, aimed to show others who I am in a unique way.
It also gave me hands-on experience deploying a real-world project from scratch.

---

## What I Learned

- How to deploy a React app manually using GitHub Pages
- How to configure DNS and custom domain settings on Namecheap
- How to troubleshoot SSL certificate issues and DNS propagation delays
- How to use Tailwind CSS efficiently for layout and spacing

---

## Live Website

[https://christopherenriquez.dev](https://christopherenriquez.dev)

Hosted statically through GitHub.

---

## Deployment Process

1. Ran `npm run build` to generate production-ready files
2. Uploaded everything from the `/dist` folder (not the folder itself) to GitHub
3. Connected my GitHub Pages repo to a custom domain
4. Configured A and CNAME records in Namecheap
5. Waited for DNS and SSL to fully propagate

---

## Next Steps

- Alter color palette to seem more professional
- Add to experience sections and project
- Change Hire Me Button into a Download my CV button

Thanks for checking it out!

- Chris
